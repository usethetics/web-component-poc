# Accessibility

_Status: **In development**_

**_The following are general accessibility guidelines and pointers, please refer to each individual pattern or component for their specific guidelines._**

A digital product should be available to the widest audience possible. Anyone with access to the internet, regardless of the choice of platform, browser or (long-term or temporary) disability should be able to use the products we create.

Often cited in the context of visual impairments (1 in 30 people has some form of visual impairment and 1 in 188 people is blind), accessibility is a much broader principle.

The spectrum of disabilities includes users who depend on keyboard-only use, dyslexics, are color blind (1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women are color blind), have a mobility impairment or a temporary disability. In total, about 15 to 20% of the population has some form of visual, auditory, physical or cognitive disability.

_“Accessibility is simply the absence of barriers.”_

Disabilities that can pose problems for website users can range from mild to severe:

*   limited mobility (e.g. problems with mouse interaction)
*   cognitive challenges (e.g. dyslexia or as a result of a stroke)
*   color blindness (e.g. not being able to perceive a difference between warning and information colors)
*   epileptic disorders (e.g. sensitivity to fast animations)
*   visual impairment (e.g. reduced vision due to cataracts)
*   total blindness
*   a temporary or situational disability (for example, a broken primary arm, forgetting reading glasses)

Incorporating universal accessibility principles into the design and development process is a small effort that contributes to overall usability and content discovery by search engines. An accessible product means a useful product for everyone!
