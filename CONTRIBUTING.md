# Contributing

## Code of Conduct

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. Read [our Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) if you haven't already.

## TL;DR

Before you make a commit or PR, install our code check tools using `npm ci` and then `npm run bootstrap`. Run `npm run lint` and `npm run test` to see if everything is in order. Many things can be fixed automatically using `npm run lint-fix`. Make separate commits for separate purposes. Prefix all your commit message with `fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:` or any of [the other allowed commit types](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#type). When you make a PR you will need to sign our [Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md), so first check with your employer if you need to.

## Processes

This projects uses the following processes:

- [Required code reviews](https://github.com/features/code-review/): every PR needs to be approved by (other) maintainers before it can be merged.
- Required code checks: code must match our defined code style, tests and builds need to succeed before a PR can be merged.
- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): commits messages should follow the specified pattern, so we can have nice things such as automatic semantic versioning and automatically generating change logs based on the commit history.
- [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org)

## Code Style

The project uses the following tools to automate checking and fixing code style rules:

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org) ([rules](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/))
- [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org)
- [HTML-validate](https://html-validate.org) ([rules](https://html-validate.org/rules/index.html))
- [npm-package-json-lint](https://npmpackagejsonlint.org/) ([rules](https://npmpackagejsonlint.org/docs/en/rules))
- [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) ([rules](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint#rules--aliases))
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
- [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) ([rules](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules/list))

Check of there are plugins available for your code editor of choice, to enable these tools during development. That way you won't find yourself alerted by Husky and lint-staged to fix formatting issues, just when you are about to commit your code.

For automating checks:

- [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky): automatically install Git hooks
- [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) - quickly run code style checks for only the files that are staged in Git

### CSS

CSS is formatted using stylelint. The stylelint configuration is stored in the npm package `@wesaynih.dev/stylelint-config`.

### JavaScript and TypeScript

ESLint is used for JavaScript checks. The ESLint configuration is stored in the npm package `@wesaynih.dev/eslint-config`.

### JSON

JSON is formatted using Prettier.

**Use the `.json` file extension where possible**: configuration files such as `.eslintrc.json` have an explicit file extension and is not called simply `.eslintrc` to ensure all code formatting rules can be applied automatically.

**Avoid code formatting in generated JSON files**: files generated by tools, such as `package.json` that regularly updated using `npm install`, should be excempt from automatic formatting. Configure these files in `.prettierignore`.
